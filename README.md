# Strategic Specialization Roadmap: AI, Cloud & Intelligent Automation

This roadmap outlines my professional evolution from a Senior Frontend Developer to an **Intelligent Automation & Cloud Specialist**. It focuses on Python-driven data extraction, AI integration, and scalable infrastructure.

## 🎯 High-Level Goals
- Transition from Basic Python to **Advanced Data Engineering**.
- Implement **AI-powered Web Crawling** (LangChain + Scrapy).
- Master **Cloud Infrastructure** (AWS) for scalable deployments.
- Validate **Frontend Architecture** and **Mobile (React Native)** expertise.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Advanced Python & Intelligent Crawling
*Target: Move beyond scripts to production-ready data extraction.*

1.  **Intermediate Python (Data Processing)**:
    - [Python 3 Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming) (Univ. of Michigan)
    - *Note: Specifically Course 3 "Data Collection and Processing" to master APIs and JSON.*
2.  **Professional Web Scraping**:
    - [Web Scraping with Scrapy and Python (Guided Project)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/packt-web-scraping-tutorial-with-scrapy-and-python-for-beginners-0edsw)
    - *Note: Validated URL. Although it says "Beginners", it's the standard for mastering the Scrapy framework on Coursera.*
3.  **AI & LLM Integration**:
    - [Generative AI with LangChain](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-langchain)
    - *Focus: Building agents to parse and structure unstructured web data.*

## ☁️ Phase 2: Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
*Target: Professional certification for deploying automation at scale.*

- **Certification Path**: [AWS Certified Developer - Associate](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aws-certified-developer-associate)
- **Key Services**: Lambda (for crawlers), DynamoDB, S3, and AWS Amplify.

## 📱 Phase 3: Mobile Development
*Target: Leveraging 5+ years of React experience for the mobile ecosystem.*

- **Professional Certificate**: [Meta React Native Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/meta-react-native-specialization)
- **Skills**: Native APIs, Expo, and Cross-platform optimization.

## 🏛️ Phase 4: Frontend Architecture & Leadership
*Target: Validating Senior/Staff Engineer competencies.*

- **Professional Certificate**: [Meta Front-End Developer](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer)
    - **Active Course**: [Advanced React](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-react) *(Doing in parallel with Phase 1)*
- **Focus**: Advanced React, Testing (Jest/RTL), and Software Architecture patterns.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack Focus
- **Languages**: Python (Advanced), TypeScript, JavaScript.
- **AI/Data**: LangChain, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, OpenAI API.
- **Cloud/DevOps**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions.
- **Mobile**: React Native.
